# WiFi Simulation Projects ![WiFi Logo](https://img.icons8.com/ios-filled/50/000000/wifi.png)

Welcome to the **WiFi Simulation Projects** repository! üöÄ This project simulates the performance of WiFi networks, specifically **WiFi 4**, **WiFi 5**, and **WiFi 6**, using various communication protocols and advanced features like **CSI**, **OFDMA**, and **backoff mechanisms**. The simulations are written in **C++** and provide detailed results on key performance metrics, such as **throughput**, **latency**, and **total simulation time**.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Project Overview

This repository contains three different WiFi simulation models:

| WiFi Standard | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| **WiFi 4**    | Simulates basic packet transmission and calculates throughput. |
| **WiFi 5**    | Implements enhanced packet scheduling and parallel communication with CSI packet exchanges. |
| **WiFi 6**    | Utilizes **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)**, allowing simultaneous communication through sub-channel management. |

Each simulation evaluates the system‚Äôs performance with varying user counts and sub-channel widths (for WiFi 6).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### **WiFi 4 Simulation**
- Basic packet transmission and throughput calculation.
- Simple model to simulate performance for a small number of users.

### **WiFi 5 Simulation**
- Enhanced scheduling with **CSI packet exchanges**.
- **Parallel communication** for efficient data transfer.

### **WiFi 6 Simulation**
- **OFDMA**: Users are allocated different sub-channels for simultaneous communication.
- Testing performance impact with varying **sub-channel widths** (e.g., 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz).

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Throughput**: Total data successfully transmitted.
- **Average Latency**: Average time taken for packets to be transmitted.
- **Maximum Latency**: Maximum delay observed during the simulation.
- **Total Simulation Time**: Overall time taken to complete the simulation.
